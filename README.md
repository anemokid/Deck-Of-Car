# Deck-Of-Cards

1. What went well: 
- The layout went fine 
- Populating the RV 
- Getting the first deck id 

2. What was challenging:
- Using retrofit for query parameters, 
  I was trying to return a count of 52 cards with their information 
  So that I can programmatically keep a count for the users, and change the values based off this.
